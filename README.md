# Onepost

OnePost is social media management infrastructure for the internet. Companies use our API to create, post, and manage their social presence via programmatic communication. You can think of it like a headless Hootsuite built for developers.

Use OnePost to quickly integrate your application with Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.

1. Start by registering for the developer applications that you'll need for your application, such as Twitter and Facebook.
2. Then, use OnePost to allow your application's users to log in to each service through their web browser, thereby giving your application permission to post on their behalf.
3. Finally, post to one (or many) social pages owned by the user with a single API call. Use OnePost to track the performance of each post over time.
